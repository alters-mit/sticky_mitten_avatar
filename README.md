# Sticky Mitten Avatar Controllers

This is a collection of example controllers for TDW's [Sticky Mitten Avatar](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Documentation/misc_frontend/sticky_mitten_avatar.md). Several other controllers can be found [here](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/tree/master/Python/example_controllers) but they tend to be more nuts-and-bolts examples of how to use commands correctly. This repo commands more sophisticated control techniques for the avatar. More controllers will be added over time.

| Controller               | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `put_object_on_table.py` | Put an object on a table using a simple "aiming" algorithm to bend the arm. |
