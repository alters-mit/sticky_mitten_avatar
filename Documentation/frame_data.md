## `FrameData`

`from tdw.sticky_mitten_avatar.frame_data import FrameData`

Per-frame data that an avatar can use to decide what action to do next.

Fields:

- `audio` A list of tuples of audio generated by impacts. The first element in the tuple is a [`Base64Sound` object](https://github.com/threedworld-mit/tdw/blob/master/Documentation/python/py_impact.md#base64sound).
          The second element is the ID of the "target" (smaller) object.
          You can use the object ID to get the spatial position of the collision that created the audio.
- `images` A dictionary of tuple of images mapped to the ID of the avatar that captured the image.
           The images tuple is (segmentation pass, depth pass). Either can be None.
